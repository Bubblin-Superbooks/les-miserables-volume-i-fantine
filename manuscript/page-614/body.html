The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast. The cart was quite heavily laden. Father Fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner. They had tried, but in vain, to drag him out. An unmethodical effort, aid awkwardly given, a wrong shake, might kill him. It was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him. Javert, who had come up at the moment of the accident, had sent for a jack-screw.</p><p>M. Madeleine arrived. People stood aside respectfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; cried old Fauchelevent. &ldquo;Who will be good and save the old man?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
