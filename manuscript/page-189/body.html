<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbés, just as a general is by a covey of young officers. This is what that charming Saint François de Sales calls somewhere &ldquo;les prêtres blancs-becs,&rdquo; callow priests. Every career has its aspirants, who form a train for those who have attained eminence in it. There is no power which has not its dependents. There is no fortune which has not its court. The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present. Every metropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace, and mounts guard over monseigneur&rsquo;s smile. To please a bishop is equivalent to getting one&rsquo;s foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate. It is necessary to walk one&rsquo;s path discreetly; the apostleship does not disdain the canonship.</p></div> </div>
