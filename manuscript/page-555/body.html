The cook-shop was in a bad way.</p><p>Thanks to the traveller&rsquo;s fifty-seven francs, Thénardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month they were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette&rsquo;s outfit to Paris, and pawned it at the pawnbroker&rsquo;s for sixty francs. As soon as that sum was spent, the Thénardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity; and they treated her accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes, they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thénardier brats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the rest had left&mdash;a little better than the dog, a little worse than the cat.</p></div> </div>
