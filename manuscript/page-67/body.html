<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A tragic event occurred at D&mdash;&mdash; A man was condemned to death for murder. He was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly ignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public. The town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell ill. A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments. They sent for the curé. It seems that he refused to come, saying, &ldquo;That is no affair of mine. I have nothing to do with that unpleasant task, and with that mountebank: I, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my place.&rdquo; This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, &ldquo;Monsieur le Curé is right: it is not his place; it is mine.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
