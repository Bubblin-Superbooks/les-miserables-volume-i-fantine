Then he added, with a smile, &ldquo;To him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; murmured the curé, throwing back his head with a smile. &ldquo;God&mdash;or the Devil.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop looked steadily at the curé, and repeated with authority, &ldquo;God!&rdquo;</p><p>When he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity, all along the road. At the priest&rsquo;s house in Chastelar he rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting for him, and he said to his sister: &ldquo;Well! was I in the right? The poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
