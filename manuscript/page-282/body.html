Dogs, dogs are happier! Nineteen years! I am forty-six. Now there is the yellow passport. That is what it is like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed the Bishop, &ldquo;you have come from a very sad place. Listen. There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. If you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind, you are deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughts of good-will and of peace, you are more worthy than any one of us.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
