<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras before to-morrow. We are on a crossroad. The relays are badly served, the horses are in the fields. The season for ploughing is just beginning; heavy teams are required, and horses are seized upon everywhere, from the post as well as elsewhere. Monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay. And, then, they drive at a walk. There are many hills to ascend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come then, I will go on horseback. Unharness the cabriolet. Some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Without doubt. But will this horse bear the saddle?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
