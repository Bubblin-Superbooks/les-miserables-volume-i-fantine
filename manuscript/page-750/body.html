Among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances, which we preserve out of respect for the truth.</p><p>On the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine went to see Fantine according to his wont.</p><p>Before entering Fantine&rsquo;s room, he had Sister Simplice summoned.</p><p>The two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary, Lazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names of Sister Perp√©tue and Sister Simplice.</p></div> </div>
