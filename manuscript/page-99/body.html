These candlesticks held two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop&rsquo;s chimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table.</p><p>In the Bishop&rsquo;s own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that the key was never removed.</p><p>The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating from a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted the white wall which enclosed it.</p></div> </div>
