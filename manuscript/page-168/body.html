He looked towards heaven, and in his glance a tear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down his livid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to himself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.</p><p>After a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, person would be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it would not exist. There is, then, an I. That I of the infinite is God.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
