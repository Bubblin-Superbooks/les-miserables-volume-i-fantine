<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Bishop clapped his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s talking!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism! Not every one who wants it can have it. Ah! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidly allow one&rsquo;s self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness,&mdash;places, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or ill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,&mdash;and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished. How agreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to you, senator.</p></div> </div>
