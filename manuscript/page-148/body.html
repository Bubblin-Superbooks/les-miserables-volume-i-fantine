The two slumbers may be good neighbors.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at &ldquo;His Grace,&rdquo; was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort &ldquo;citizen.&rdquo; He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.</p></div> </div>
