<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed. You certainly do not seem to me to be ill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;I am going to recover.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, and then said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall die three hours hence.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws on. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart, I shall stop. The sun is beautiful, is it not? I had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things. You can talk to me; it does not fatigue me. You have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment.</p></div> </div>
