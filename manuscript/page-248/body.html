<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a dog&rsquo;s kennel.</p><p>He was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his staff, made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his rags.</p><p>He left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged, in order to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that man≈ìuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la rose couverte.</p><p>When he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found himself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter, without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim, &ldquo;I am not even a dog!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
