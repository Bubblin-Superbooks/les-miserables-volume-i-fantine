Now, before going to the galleys for theft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles. Another fact. This Valjean&rsquo;s Christian name was Jean, and his mother&rsquo;s surname was Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging from the galleys, he should have taken his mother&rsquo;s name for the purpose of concealing himself, and have called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes to Auvergne. The local pronunciation turns Jean into Chan&mdash;he is called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and behold him transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not? Inquiries were made at Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there. It is not known where they have gone.</p></div> </div>
