It was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, the sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers.</p><p>He had slept more than four hours. His fatigue had passed away. He was accustomed not to devote many hours to repose.</p><p>He opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; then he closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.</p><p>When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matters preoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time. Sleep comes more easily than it returns. This is what happened to Jean Valjean. He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.</p></div> </div>
