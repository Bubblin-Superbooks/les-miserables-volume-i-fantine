I have seen the child.&rdquo;</p><p>The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the guardian and door-keeper of every one&rsquo;s virtue.

In her youth, in &lsquo;93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will.</p></div> </div>
