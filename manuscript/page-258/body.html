<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had a door opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening on the garden.</p><p>Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to the table.</p><p>As she performed this service, she was conversing with Mademoiselle Baptistine.</p><p>A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood fire was burning there.</p><p>One can easily picture to one&rsquo;s self these two women, both of whom were over sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious; Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than her brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted ever since.</p></div> </div>
