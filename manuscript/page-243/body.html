Close by a very young woman was nursing another child. The father was laughing, the child was laughing, the mother was smiling.</p><p>The stranger paused a moment in reverie before this tender and calming spectacle. What was taking place within him? He alone could have told. It is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable, and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, he would find perhaps a little pity.</p><p>He tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.</p></div> </div>
