<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One morning M. Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging in advance some pressing matters connected with the mayor&rsquo;s office, in case he should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he was informed that Police Inspector Javert was desirous of speaking with him. Madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing this name. Javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the police-station, and M. Madeleine had not seen him.</p><p>&ldquo;Admit him,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Javert entered.</p><p>M. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, and which contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of police regulations. He did not disturb himself on Javert&rsquo;s account. He could not help thinking of poor Fantine, and it suited him to be glacial in his manner.</p></div> </div>
