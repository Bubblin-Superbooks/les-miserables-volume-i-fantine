On hearing the hubbub made by the passers-by, Tholomyès&rsquo; merry auditors turned their heads, and Tholomyès took advantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with this melancholy strophe:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Elle était de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses Ont le même destin; Et, rosse, elle a vécu ce que vivant les rosses, L&rsquo;espace d&rsquo;un mâtin!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Poor horse!&rdquo; sighed Fantine.</p></div> </div>
