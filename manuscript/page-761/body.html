The figures were 5, 6, 8Â½.</p><p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;total, nineteen and a half; as well say twenty leagues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor,&rdquo; returned the Fleming, &ldquo;I have just what you want. My little white horse&mdash;you may have seen him pass occasionally; he is a small beast from Lower Boulonnais. He is full of fire. They wanted to make a saddle-horse of him at first. Bah! He reared, he kicked, he laid everybody flat on the ground. He was thought to be vicious, and no one knew what to do with him. I bought him. I harnessed him to a carriage. That is what he wanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he goes like the wind. Ah! indeed he must not be mounted. It does not suit his ideas to be a saddle-horse. Every one has his ambition. &lsquo;Draw? Yes. Carry? No.&rsquo; We must suppose that is what he said to himself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
