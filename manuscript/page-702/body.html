<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I believe that it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply to me? But here; I will pay your debts, I will send for your child, or you shall go to her. You shall live here, in Paris, or where you please. I undertake the care of your child and yourself. You shall not work any longer if you do not like. I will give all the money you require. You shall be honest and happy once more. And listen! I declare to you that if all is as you say,&mdash;and I do not doubt it,&mdash;you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
