He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the remnant of Gaspard Bès&rsquo;s troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his way to Piédmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of Barcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hid himself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l&rsquo;Aigle, and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye and Ubayette.</p></div> </div>
