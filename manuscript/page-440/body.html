<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At the age of ten, Fantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood. At fifteen she came to Paris &ldquo;to seek her fortune.&rdquo; Fantine was beautiful, and remained pure as long as she could. She was a lovely blonde, with fine teeth. She had gold and pearls for her dowry; but her gold was on her head, and her pearls were in her mouth.</p><p>She worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,&mdash;for the heart, also, has its hunger,&mdash;she loved.</p><p>She loved Tholomyès.</p><p>An amour for him; passion for her. The streets of the Latin quarter, filled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning of their dream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomyès in the mazes of the hill of the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but in such a way as constantly to encounter him again. There is a way of avoiding which resembles seeking. In short, the eclogue took place.</p></div> </div>
