A sharp, harsh noise, which made him drop his eyes, resounded from the earth.</p><p>Below him he perceived two red stars, whose rays lengthened and shortened in a singular manner through the darkness.</p><p>As his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep, &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are no stars in the sky.

By the light which they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle. It was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse. The noise which he had heard was the trampling of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs on the pavement.</p></div> </div>
