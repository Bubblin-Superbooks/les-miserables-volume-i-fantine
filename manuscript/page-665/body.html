A dolorous bargain. A soul for a morsel of bread. Misery offers; society accepts.</p><p>The sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization, but it does not, as yet, permeate it; it is said that slavery has disappeared from European civilization. This is a mistake. It still exists; but it weighs only upon the woman, and it is called prostitution.</p><p>It weighs upon the woman, that is to say, upon grace, weakness, beauty, maternity.
