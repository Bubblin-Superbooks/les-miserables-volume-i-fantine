<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> you are certainly obliged to preserve order, you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since you are a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is for the sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child. &lsquo;Only, don&rsquo;t do it again, you hussy!&rsquo; Oh! I won&rsquo;t do it again, Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to me now; I will not stir. But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me. I was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; and then as I told you, I am not well; I have a cough; I seem to have a burning ball in my stomach, and the doctor tells me, &lsquo;Take care of yourself.&rsquo; Here, feel, give me your hand; don&rsquo;t be afraid&mdash;it is here.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
