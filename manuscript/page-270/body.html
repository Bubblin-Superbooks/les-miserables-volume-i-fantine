<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This evening, when I arrived in these parts, I went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport, which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to an inn. They said to me, &lsquo;Be off,&rsquo; at both places. No one would take me. I went to the prison; the jailer would not admit me. I went into a dog&rsquo;s kennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been a man. One would have said that he knew who I was. I went into the fields, intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There were no stars. I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the town, to seek the recess of a doorway. Yonder, in the square, I meant to sleep on a stone bench. A good woman pointed out your house to me, and said to me, &lsquo;Knock there!&rsquo; I have knocked. What is this place? Do you keep an inn? I have money&mdash;savings.</p></div> </div>
