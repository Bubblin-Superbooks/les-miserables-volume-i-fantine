I thought he had a rather singular air.&rdquo;</p><p>This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine&rsquo;s chamber. He paid no heed to the portress&rsquo;s words, but went to bed and to sleep. Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head. He listened; it was a footstep pacing back and forth, as though some one were walking in the room above him. He listened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine&rsquo;s step. This struck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine&rsquo;s chamber until he rose in the morning.</p></div> </div>
