<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she realized the ideal expressed by the word &ldquo;respectable&rdquo;; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;&mdash;a mere pretext for a soul&rsquo;s remaining on the earth.</p></div> </div>
