<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Such was M. Myriel&rsquo;s budget.</p><p>As for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans, dispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or chapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.</p><p>After a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had and those who lacked knocked at M. Myriel&rsquo;s door,&mdash;the latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress. Considerable sums of money passed through his hands, but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities.</p></div> </div>
