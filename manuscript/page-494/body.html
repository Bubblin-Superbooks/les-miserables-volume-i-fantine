<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open. No quarter, war to the death! a pretty woman is a casus belli; a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor. All the invasions of history have been determined by petticoats. Woman is man&rsquo;s right. Romulus carried off the Sabines; William carried off the Saxon women; Cæsar carried off the Roman women. The man who is not loved soars like a vulture over the mistresses of other men; and for my own part, to all those unfortunate men who are widowers, I throw the sublime proclamation of Bonaparte to the army of Italy: &ldquo;Soldiers, you are in need of everything; the enemy has it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tholomyès paused.</p></div> </div>
