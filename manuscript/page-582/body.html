He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinkling it and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution of common salt; and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot in bloom everywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among the grass and in the houses.</p><p>He had &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; for exterminating from a field, blight, tares, foxtail, and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat.
