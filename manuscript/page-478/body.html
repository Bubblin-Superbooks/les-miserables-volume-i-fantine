<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Dahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I? I detest him,&rdquo; replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her fork again. &ldquo;He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in my house. He is very nice, that young man; do you know him? One can see that he is an actor by profession. I love actors. As soon as he comes in, his mother says to him: &lsquo;Ah! mon Dieu! my peace of mind is gone. There he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting my head!&rsquo; So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as he can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know what? so that he can be heard downstairs! He earns twenty sous a day at an attorney&rsquo;s by penning quibbles.</p></div> </div>
