You receive me into your house. You light your candles for me. Yet I have not concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunate man.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand. &ldquo;You could not help telling me who you were. This is not my house; it is the house of Jesus Christ. This door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer, you are hungry and thirsty; you are welcome. And do not thank me; do not say that I receive you in my house.</p></div> </div>
