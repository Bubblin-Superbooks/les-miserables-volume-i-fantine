Have you rambled through the brushwood, holding aside the branches, on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you? Have you slid, laughing, down a slope all wet with rain, with a beloved woman holding your hand, and crying, &ldquo;Ah, my new boots! what a state they are in!&rdquo;</p><p>Let us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking in the case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said as they set out, with a magisterial and maternal tone, &ldquo;The slugs are crawling in the paths,&mdash;a sign of rain, children.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
