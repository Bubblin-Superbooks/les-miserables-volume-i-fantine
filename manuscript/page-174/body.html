<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This &ldquo;pastoral visit&rdquo; naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries.</p><p>&ldquo;Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop? There was evidently no conversion to be expected. All those revolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? What was there to be seen there? He must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil.&rdquo;</p><p>One day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual, addressed this sally to him, &ldquo;Monseigneur, people are inquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! oh! that&rsquo;s a coarse color,&rdquo; replied the Bishop. &ldquo;It is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
