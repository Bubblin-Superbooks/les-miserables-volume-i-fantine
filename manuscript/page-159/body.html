Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?&rdquo;</p><p>A momentary silence ensued. The Bishop almost regretted having come, and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.</p><p>The conventionary resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ loved them. He seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge, full of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried, &lsquo;Sinite parvulos,&rsquo; he made no distinction between the little children. It would not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin of Barabbas and the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, is its own crown. Innocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
