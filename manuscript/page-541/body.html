<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work will not permit it. With a child one can find no situation. People are ridiculous in the country. It was the good God who caused me to pass your inn. When I caught sight of your little ones, so pretty, so clean, and so happy, it overwhelmed me. I said: &lsquo;Here is a good mother. That is just the thing; that will make three sisters.&rsquo; And then, it will not be long before I return. Will you keep my child for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must see about it,&rdquo; replied the Th√©nardier.</p><p>&ldquo;I will give you six francs a month.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
