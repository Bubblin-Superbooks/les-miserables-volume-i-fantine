One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away.&rdquo;</p><p>It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set out again at a gallop. This surprised Fantine.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I thought the diligence never stopped.&rdquo;</p><p>Favourite shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;This Fantine is surprising. I am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: I am a traveller; I say to the diligence, &lsquo;I will go on in advance; you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass.&rsquo; The diligence passes, sees me, halts, and takes me. That is done every day. You do not know life, my dear.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
