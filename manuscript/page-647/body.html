I have clothed her with my hair.&rdquo; She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head, and in which she was still pretty.</p><p>Dark thoughts held possession of Fantine&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>When she saw that she could no longer dress her hair, she began to hate every one about her. She had long shared the universal veneration for Father Madeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness, she came to hate him also, and most of all. When she passed the factory in working hours, when the workpeople were at the door, she affected to laugh and sing.</p></div> </div>
