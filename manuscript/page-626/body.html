<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When work is abundant, when the country is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing. It may be said, that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches,&mdash;the cost of collecting the taxes. In the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by M. de Vill√®le, then Minister of Finance.</p><p>Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. No one remembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine&rsquo;s factory was like the face of a friend. She presented herself there, and was admitted to the women&rsquo;s workroom. The trade was entirely new to Fantine; she could not be very skilful at it, and she therefore earned but little by her day&rsquo;s work; but it was sufficient; the problem was solved; she was earning her living.</p></div> </div>
