It is more Asiatic. Look at the room downstairs; there are mirrors [glaces] on the walls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I prefer them [glaces, ices] on my plate,&rdquo; said Favourite.</p><p>Blachevelle persisted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Look at the knives. The handles are of silver at Bombarda&rsquo;s and of bone at Édon&rsquo;s. Now, silver is more valuable than bone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Except for those who have a silver chin,&rdquo; observed Tholomyès.</p></div> </div>
