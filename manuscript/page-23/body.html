<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In 1815, M. Charles-Fran√ßois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash; He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see of D&mdash;&mdash; since 1806.</p><p>Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar.</p></div> </div>
