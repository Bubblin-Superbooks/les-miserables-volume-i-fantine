Take them.&rdquo;</p><p>He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, and brought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without uttering a word, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert the Bishop.</p><p>Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticks mechanically, and with a bewildered air.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;go in peace. By the way, when you return, my friend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always enter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with anything but a latch, either by day or by night.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
