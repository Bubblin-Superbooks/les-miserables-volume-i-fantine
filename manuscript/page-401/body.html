<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first taken.</p><p>In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling, shouting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where three paths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen. He sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, &ldquo;Little Gervais! Little Gervais! Little Gervais!&rdquo; His shout died away in the mist, without even awakening an echo. He murmured yet once more, &ldquo;Little Gervais!&rdquo; but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice.</p></div> </div>
