<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur&rsquo;s dining-room?&rdquo; exclaimed the stupefied director.</p><p>The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;It would hold full twenty beds,&rdquo; said he, as though speaking to himself. Then, raising his voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something. There is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of you, in five or six small rooms. There are three of us here, and we have room for sixty. There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have yours. Give me back my house; you are at home here.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
