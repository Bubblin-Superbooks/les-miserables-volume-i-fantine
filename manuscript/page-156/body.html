Alas! The work was incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is not sufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; the wind is still there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a demolition complicated with wrath.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of progress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French Revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime.</p></div> </div>
