<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is by two doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard filled with manure. The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He slipped into the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and opened the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; said the master.</p><p>&ldquo;Some one who wants supper and bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. We furnish supper and bed here.&rdquo;</p><p>He entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. The lamp illuminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.</p></div> </div>
