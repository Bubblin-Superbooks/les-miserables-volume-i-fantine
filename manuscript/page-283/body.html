She had, of her own accord, added to the Bishop&rsquo;s ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauves wine.</p><p>The Bishop&rsquo;s face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable natures. &ldquo;To table!&rdquo; he cried vivaciously. As was his custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit on his right. Mademoiselle Baptistine, perfectly peaceable and natural, took her seat at his left.</p><p>The Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, according to his custom. The man began to eat with avidity.</p></div> </div>
