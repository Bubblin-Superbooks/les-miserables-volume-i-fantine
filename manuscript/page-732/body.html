<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named Brevet, who is detained for I know not what, and who has been appointed turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no sooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: &lsquo;Eh! Why, I know that man! He is a fagot! Take a good look at me, my good man! You are Jean Valjean!&rsquo; &lsquo;Jean Valjean! who&rsquo;s Jean Valjean?&rsquo; Champmathieu feigns astonishment. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t play the innocent dodge,&rsquo; says Brevet. &lsquo;You are Jean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty years ago; we were there together.&rsquo; Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You understand. The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated for me. This is what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirty years ago, a pruner of trees in various localities, notably at Faverolles. There all trace of him was lost.</p></div> </div>
